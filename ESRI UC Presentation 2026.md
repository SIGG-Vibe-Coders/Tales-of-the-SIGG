# [Scene: ESRI User Conference – Breakout Session Room]
Alex (the introducer, overly enthusiastic):
“Ladies and gentlemen, fellow geospatial wizards, it is my absolute pleasure to introduce today’s speaker. 
A trailblazer in spatial analysis. A boundary-breaking cartographic rebel. A man who once did an entire project using only a spreadsheet and pure spite. Please welcome… Daniel Otto!” 
# [Applause. You walk up to the podium, nodding politely. Then you lean in to the mic.]
Daniel:
“Thank you, Alex. That was a lovely introduction — especially considering what's about to happen.”
“Let’s get something out of the way: ESRI products are overpriced, unnecessarily complicated, and held together by a dark pact made in Redlands.”
# [Scattered gasps. One person drops their ESRI lanyard.]
“This presentation is called: ‘How to Not Use ESRI — A Survival Guide for the Financially and Mentally Conscious.’”
“Over the next 45 minutes, I will show you how to build a spatial analysis stack using tools that won’t cost your department the entire training budget, 
won’t crash when you move a label, and don’t require a license server that’s somehow offline every Friday at 3pm.”
“You’ll learn about QGIS, Python, Leaflet, and other beautiful, open, community-driven tools that ask for your creativity, not your wallet. 
And best of all? At no point will I make you pretend that ArcCatalog was a good idea.”
“Let’s begin.”
